* Removed "Grab" action and added "LeftGrab" and "RightGrab"
* Removed outdated code that supports HUD sprites for resolutions below 640x480 (fixes issues with WMR)
* Added immersive ladder climbing: Grab ladders with controllers and pull up or down to move
* Added visual damage feedback in form of pulsating gradient overlay (dark blue for drowning, light blue for freezing, green for poison/radiation, red for every other damage)
