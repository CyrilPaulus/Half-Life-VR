== FEMALE SCIENTIST AUDIO FILES ==
Female scientist audio files have been generated using MorphVox Pro with the Batch Converter Plugin, postprocessed using Auphonic, and then converted to a Half-Life friendly wav format with GoldWave. They are based on the original scientist audio files for Half-Life by Valve.
