List of known bugs and issues:

- HUD text is rendered in the map center instead of somewhere in the player's view
- Some weapon animations don't play correctly
- Female scientists are missing some animations
- "Hold" use actions sometimes don't work (e.g. rotating a valve or using a health charger)
- For some people "Steam VR environment" needs to be disabled for the mod to run
- func_pushables don't work (on purpose to avoid nausea), making some areas inaccessible and make progress in one level impossible (giant fan that pushes player up)
- Some fans, elevators and other moving things push the player around even when not really touching them
- Fast moving platforms catapult the player off

====
List of missing features:

- Controls for func_tank and func_tracktrain
- Proper teleportation arc that matches path of jumping player
- Menu in VR
- Intercept loading (currently the Steam VR environment shows up for a short moment on level changes)
- VR related options are a mess and only configurable via console
